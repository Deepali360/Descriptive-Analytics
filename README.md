# **Descriptive and Predictive Analytics Projects**

Welcome to my **Descriptive and Predictive Analytics** repository! ðŸš€ This repository showcases projects where I have applied analytical techniques using **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Python**. It highlights my ability to draw insights from data and use predictive modeling to support decision-making.

## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Descriptive Analytics**
Descriptive analytics focuses on analyzing historical data to understand trends and patterns. Below are some of the descriptive projects included in this repository:
- **Excel Dashboards**: 
  - Created interactive dashboards to summarize key metrics and trends.
  - Utilized pivot tables, conditional formatting, and advanced formulas for data visualization.
- **Power BI Reports**: 
  - Built dynamic reports to visualize data trends, enabling business insights through intuitive visuals.
  - Integrated multiple data sources and created calculated columns/measures using DAX.
- **Python Scripts**:
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
  - Analyzed datasets to identify trends, anomalies, and correlations.

### **2. Predictive Analytics**
Predictive analytics involves using statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast future outcomes. Projects in this section include:
- **Regression Analysis** (Python):
  - Implemented linear regression, random forest regression, and XGBoost to predict target variables.
  - Tuned hyperparameters using grid search to achieve optimal performance metrics.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Models evaluated using MAE, MSE, and RMSE to ensure accuracy and reliability.
  - Example Results: 
    - **Linear Regression**: MAE = 13.07 | RMSE = 17.74
    - **Random Forest Regression**: MAE = 2.44 | RMSE = 4.92
    - **XGBoost Regression**: MAE = 1.67 | RMSE = 3.52
- **Power BI for Predictive Insights**:
  - Integrated Python scripts into Power BI to enhance forecasting visuals.
  - Created dashboards to present predictive outcomes.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Excel**: Advanced formulas, pivot tables, charts, and dashboards.
- **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations.
- **Python**: Libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `xgboost`.

## **Future Work**
This repository is a work in progress! I plan to continue adding projects, exploring new datasets, and incorporating advanced techniques, including:
- Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
- Integration of SQL for database queries.
- Time Series Forecasting Projects.
- Power BI storytelling with custom visuals.
